# Red Sangria

## Ingredients

* 1/2 medium apple (cored, skin on, chopped into small pieces)
* 1/2 medium orange (rind on, sliced into small pieces, large seeds removed // plus more for garnish)
* 3-4 Tbsp organic brown sugar (or 3 Tbsp (37.5 g) organic cane sugar as original recipe is written)
* 3/4 cup orange juice (plus more to taste)
* 1/3 cup brandy (plus more to taste)
* 750 ml bottle of Garnacha or Pinot Noir
* ~1 cup Ice to chill

## Instructions

* Add apples, oranges, and sugar to a large pitcher and muddle with a muddler or wooden spoon for 45 seconds.
* Add orange juice and brandy and muddle again to combine for 30 seconds.
* Add red wine and stir to incorporate, then taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added a bit more brandy, orange juice and brown sugar. Stir to combine.
* Add ice and stir once more to chill. Serve as is, or with a bit more ice. Garnish with orange segments (optional).
* Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours, though best when fresh.
