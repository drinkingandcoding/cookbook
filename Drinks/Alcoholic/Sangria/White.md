# White Sangria

## Ingredients

* 1 medium lime (thinly sliced into rounds)
* 1 medium lemon (thinly sliced into rounds)
* 1/4 cup organic cane sugar (or sub agave, powdered coconut sugar, maple syrup, or stevia to taste // for drier sangria, omit)
* 1/4 cup apple brandy (Lairdâ€™s Apple Jack brand // or sub brandy, but apple brandy has a subtler apple flavor + smoother, gentler finish)
* 1/2 medium organic green apple (cored, skin on, chopped into small pieces)
* 1 medium ripe peach, nectarine, or pear (thinly sliced)
* 1 cup sliced strawberries // For summer
* 1 750-ml bottle dry, crisp white wine (chilled // I prefer white table wine from Spain or Portugal (I liked Alianca brand!) but Sauvignon Blanc adds a nice complexity, and Pinot Grigio works, too)
* lil mint

## Instructions

* Add lime, lemon, and sugar (or other sweeteners) to a large pitcher (or use multiple pitchers if making a larger batch) and muddle with a muddler or gently crush with a wooden spoon for 45 seconds.
* Add apple brandy and muddle again to combine for 30 seconds. Add apple, nectarine, and strawberries and stir to incorporate. Then add wine and stir once more.
* Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener of choice for sweetness, lemon or lime juice for acidity, or fruit. Stir to combine.
* Add ice or frozen berries and stir once more to chill. Serve as is or with a bit more ice and mint (optional). To dilute the mixture, top off glasses with a bit of sparkling water (optional).
* Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours, though best when enjoyed within the first 1-2 days.
