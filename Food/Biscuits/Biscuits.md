## Ingredients

* 15 oz all-purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp white sugar
* 4 tsp baking powder
* .5 tsp baking soda 
* 1.5 tsp kosher salt
* 8 oz (2 sticks) unsalted butter, frozen 
* 1.25 Cups buttermilk, cold
* 2 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted 
* As needed finishing salt 

## Instructions

* In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
* Grate the frozen butter sticks into the bowl and fold to combine.
* Make a well in the flour/butter mixture and add the buttermilk. 
* Mix until a very loose dough forms, then turn the dough out onto a heavy floured work surface.
* Gently roll the dough out to a rectangle about 12” x 9”. Using a bench scraper, fold the rectangle in thirds.
* Re-flour the work surface and rotate the dough 90°. Repeat the rolling, folding, and rotating method five times to create a network of flaky butter layers. 
* Wrap the final dough envelope in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to overnight. Towards the end of the resting time, preheat the oven to 400 °F. 
* Flour the work surface once more and place the chilled dough in the center. Roll the dough out to a rectangle about 10” x 6” and ½ inch in thickness.
* Using a very sharp blade, cut off the edges to form a perfect rectangle. Then cut the rectangle in half lengthwise and again, in thirds horizontally. The result should be 6 equally sized biscuits. Be sure not to touch the cut sides with your fingers, this will cause the biscuits to bake unevenly. 
* Transfer the biscuits to a large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush them with melted butter and a sprinkling of finishing salt. 
* Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and doubled in height.
* Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before slicing in half and/or serving.
