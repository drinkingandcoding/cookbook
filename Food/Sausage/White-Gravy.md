* Source: [Basics with Babish](https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/biscuits-and-gravy)

## Ingredients

* 6 breakfast sausages, casings removed
* 1 Tbsp unsalted butter + more if needed
* 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour 
* 1 Cup whole milk 
* To taste kosher salt 
* To taste freshly ground black pepper 

## Instructions
* In a large skillet, add the sausage meat and cook over medium-high heat until completely browned. Be sure to break up any large chunks with a wooden spatula or a potato masher. 
* Add butter and allow it to melt and combine with the rendered pork fat. If there is less than 1 tablespoon of rendered pork fat, add an additional tablespoon of butter.
* Add the flour and stir to combine with a wooden spatula. Once the flour and fat has combined to form a roux, cook for an additional minute to cook the raw flour. 
* Slowly add milk in multiple additions, making sure each addition has been fully incorporated before adding the next. Continue cooking the mixture over medium-low heat until thickened, about 2-3 minutes.
* Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
* Serve atop freshly baked biscuits.
